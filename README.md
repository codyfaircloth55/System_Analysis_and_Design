# Systems-Design-and-Analysis
The DriverPass project was a project for a ficticious company, DriverPass. The client wanted their system rebuilt to accommodate new requirements and needs.
They wanted an online storefront to sell products and provide access to purchased products to their customers. The client in this project was DriverPass.
DriverPass wanted a web-based "storefront" system for the sale of their products and services.
In this project, I believe I did particularly well in my UML diagrams in the System Design Document. If I had to improve a portion of this project I would improve the 
Business Requirements Document. I would add additional details to the purpose of the project as well as add details to what the client wishes to change in their system.
I interpreted the user's needs from the supporting materials provided as well as added some from my own thoughts that were intuitive for the system design. It is important
to understand the user's needs so you can create an enjoyable and safe experience for the end-user. It is important to obtain feedback of features the user would like to see
added in the feature as well as bugs that need to be patched out. Ultimately, in this scenario, this system is for a business and the best way to retain customers and
attract new customers is to provide a user experience which is enjoyable and meets the needs of the end user.
I approach designing software and systems in a way similar to solving a puzzle. You collect the pieces, user requirements, and put the pieces together, implementation and design.
The most important strategy is understanding requirements. Communinication with the client and feedback from users are great ways to fully understand your requirements.
