<h2>CS 255 System Analysis and Design</h2>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>The DriverPass project was a project for a fictitious company, DriverPass. The client wanted their system rebuilt to accommodate new requirements and needs. They wanted an online storefront to sell products and provide access to purchased products to their customers.</p>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<p>In this project, I believe I did particularly well in my UML diagrams in the System Design Document.</p>
<h3>Improvements:</h3>
<p>If I had to improve a portion of this project I would improve the Business Requirements Document. I would add additional details to the purpose of the project and add details to what the client wishes to change in their system.</p>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p>I interpreted the user's needs from the supporting materials provided and added some from what I thought would be intuitive for the system design. It is important to understand the user's needs so you can create an enjoyable and safe experience for the end-user. It is important to obtain feedback on features the user would like to see added in the future and bugs that need to be patched out. Ultimately, in this scenario, this system is for a business and the best way to retain customers and attract new customers is to provide a user experience that is enjoyable and meets the needs of the end user.</p>
<h3>Approach:</h3>
<p>I approach designing software and systems in a way similar to solving a puzzle. You collect the pieces, which are user requirements, and put the pieces together, which are implementation and design. The most important strategy is understanding requirements. Communication with the client and feedback from users are great ways to fully understand your requirements.</p>
